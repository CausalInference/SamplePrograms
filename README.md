## Inverse Probability Weighting of Marginal Structural Cox Models
- SAS: [Sample Program](/MSMCOX.sas) to estimate the parameter of a marginal structural Cox model. An earlier version of this program appeared in the appendix of Hernán, Brumback, and Robins (2000).

## G-estimation of Structural Nested Models
- SAS: [Sample Program](/SNAFTM.sas) to simulate data from a Structural Nested Accelerated Failure Time Model as described by Young et al.
